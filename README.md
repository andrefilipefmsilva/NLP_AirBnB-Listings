# Predicting Listing Status of AirBnB properties using NLP techniques

Work done as part of the Text Mining course at Nova IMS.

This work has limitations in terms of the final code and final report, due to computational resource constraints and time constraints.

Nonetheless, it still provided good predictions and we got a good grade. Even if we did not have the time to explore every route we wanted to, in pursuit of better results.
